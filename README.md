A break out of classes and modules as I attempt to implement the algorithms I learned
in OR 643 Network Optimization at George Mason University.  The algorithms and classes
were originally in VBA and converted to Python.

I am always eager for and constructive criticism.  Feel free to contact me: craig.j.mcclellan@gmail.com
